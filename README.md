# Github-Demo
A Repository to Demonstrate some features of github and remote git repositories

and to demonstrate how pull requests can be used to annoy repository owners

(and to demonstrate how repository maintainers and pull request senders can annoy each other indefinitely)

((seriously though everyone please don't actually submit random pull requests to real repositories (this repo is fine), they can get pretty annoying.))
